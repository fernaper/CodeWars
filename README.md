## Introduction

What is Codewars? [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a web page where you can face programming challenges and improve your skills.

Codewars was structured in Katas. The word "kata" cames from the Japanese and it is associated with training in martial arts.

The conceptual idea here is just the same. You use katas (problems) to practice and improve your skills alone or with others at the language you want.

The Katas are structured on different kyu's (levels). These are:

## Kata Kyu

| Rank       |      Kyu      |
| ---------- | :-----------: |
| Proficient | 1 kyu - 2 kyu |
| Competent  | 3 kyu - 4 kyu |
| Novice     | 5 kyu - 6 kyu |
| Beginner   | 7 kyu - 8 kyu |
